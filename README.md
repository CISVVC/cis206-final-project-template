# Final Project CIS206 Step 1

> Write a Java program which will convert a CSV file containing covid 19 data into javascript object notation (JSON)
> data.

> For this project, you will want to use a combination of ArrayLists (or a regular array) and one of the Map Collections
> Hashmap or Tree Map.  The conversion will involve reading the data file line by line reading it into the appropriate
> structure.  Do this in a method called read_records. When the structure is filled, then send the structure to a method called print_records which will print it out in the following format:
